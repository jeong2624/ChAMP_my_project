# DNA_methylation_ChAMP

This is my project for DNA methylation analysis.

My project is differentially methylated analysis between control and bipolar group.

### Dataset information
* Infinium MethylationEPIC array chip (850K) platform
* Post-mortem hippocampus tissue
* the number of control group is 32 samples
* the number of bipolar group is 32 samples
* GSE129428

### We used ChAMP R package for analyzing DNA methylation.

we tried to do these step. (based on ChAMP R package tutorial code)
* Preprocessing step
* Quality control step
* Differentially methylated analysis
* Gene Set Enrichment analysis
* Copy number variation
